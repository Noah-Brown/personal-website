# Hello, World!

Welcome to my blog! This is the first post on my new personal website.

## Why I built this site

I wanted a simple, clean space to share my thoughts on software engineering, side projects, and things I'm learning along the way. No distractions — just writing.

## What to expect

I plan to write about:

- **Software development** — tools, patterns, and lessons learned
- **Side projects** — what I'm building and why
- **Learning in public** — sharing what I pick up as I go

## The tech stack

This site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build), styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), and deployed to GitHub Pages. It's fast, minimal, and easy to maintain — exactly what I was looking for.

Thanks for stopping by. More posts coming soon!
