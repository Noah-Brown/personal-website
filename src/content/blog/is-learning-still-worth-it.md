title: "Is Learning Still Worth It?"

For the first time in my life, I'm not sure learning is worth it.

What is the point of grinding through a new skill when I can ask an AI and get a PhD-level response in seconds? Is there something inherently more valuable in *knowing* something versus knowing how to look it up? This question has been asked before — every time a technology offloads a part of our cognition to a machine, the old guard wonders if we're making ourselves worse off. But we're approaching something different now. Previous tools offloaded specific skills. AI threatens to offload *thinking itself*. It is easier than ever to wear the appearance of wisdom without any of the substance. In the coming years, we'll all have to grapple with why we learn — and whether we should bother at all.

This isn't the first time humans have stared down a technology and asked "does this make us obsolete?" There's actually a surprisingly consistent pattern across history: a new tool arrives, a specific cognitive skill gets offloaded, the gatekeepers panic, and the world quietly gets better in ways nobody predicted. Let's run the tape.

Slop was on the rise in Athens — not AI slop, but rather the written word. If thoughts could be written down, there was no longer a reason to commit them to memory, a skill prized among great orators like Socrates. In Plato's [*Phaedrus*](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1636/1636-h/1636-h.htm), Socrates makes a complaint that could have been posted on Twitter yesterday:

> "They will be hearers of many things and will have learned nothing; they will appear to be omniscient and will generally know nothing; they will be tiresome company, having the show of wisdom without the reality."
>
> — Socrates, via Plato's *Phaedrus*

Swap "hearers" for "prompters" and this reads like a critique of ChatGPT users. Socrates was right that the tradition of [oral memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_tradition) faded. But in return, we get to know about Socrates at all — because Plato wrote it down.

The Dominican friar [Filippo de Strata](https://www.medievalsourcesbibliography.org/authors.php?id=1741) declared that "the pen is a virgin, but the printing press is a whore," arguing that mass-produced books cheapened knowledge. The concern was two-fold: common people would have access to ideas previously gatekept by clergy and scholars, and an explosion of low-quality content would flood the market. Sound familiar?

The gatekeepers were right that they'd lose control of the narrative. By 1500, [printing presses were operating in over 250 cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press) across Europe, and historians estimate the continent went from roughly 30,000 books to between 10 and 20 million in just fifty years. They just didn't anticipate that losing control would pour gasoline on the [Renaissance](https://www.history.com/articles/printing-press-renaissance). Democratized knowledge turned out to be worth the noise.

The [Luddites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite) of early 1800s England were textile workers who didn't take automation lying down. Beginning in [Nottingham in March 1811](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/what-the-luddites-really-fought-against-264412/), they organized raids to smash the machines replacing them — and their concern was entirely legitimate. Skilled artisanal weavers were made obsolete by steam-powered mills that produced more fabric, faster, while extracting more wealth for the owners of capital. The government eventually [deployed 13,000 troops](https://www.history.com/articles/who-were-the-luddites) and made machine-breaking punishable by death.

This example gets closer to our current moment because a subset of workers were *entirely replaced*. But the industrial revolution offloaded *muscle*, not mind. There were still plenty of jobs that required thinking, and workers could re-skill into new fields. There was still an obvious reason to learn new things.

The uncomfortable question for our era: what happens when the re-skilling target keeps moving faster than humans can adapt?

<div class="hc-tradeoff">

<div class="hc-gained"><div class="hc-label hc-label-gained">what we gained</div>Mass production, new industries, higher-order work</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

Each wave follows the same script: a specific cognitive or physical skill is offloaded to a machine, the people who depended on that skill panic, and the world eventually benefits in ways nobody predicted. But notice the escalation.

<div class="section-break"><span>&gt;</span> the two meanings of worth</div>

To answer whether learning is "worth it," we have to be honest about what "worth" means. In modern America, it's rare to find a learning environment that isn't laser-focused on making your labor valuable. For the vast majority of people, the primary income source in life is trading labor for wages. The more skill and knowledge you have, the more your labor is worth. I know I've viewed learning through this lens for most of my adult life — especially for college and beyond. My decisions on what to learn have always been based on what would put me at an advantage in the labor market, what could land the next promotion, what would look good on a resume.

Under this frame, AI is genuinely threatening. If a machine can write the code, draft the email, debug the network, and summarize the documentation — what exactly am I selling?

But there's a second way to think about the worth of learning: for its own sake. Learning can be rewarding by giving the learner more understanding of the world and their fellow humans. The satisfaction of finally grasping how something works. The slow accumulation of context that lets you ask better questions. The ability to smell when something is wrong, even if you can't immediately articulate why.

<div class="section-break"><span>&gt;</span> the argument for still learning</div>

Here's what I keep coming back to: AI might actually be doing us a favor by burning down the pretense that learning was ever primarily about economic utility. That framing was always incomplete. The people who keep learning — who learn to code even though AI can code, who study history even though AI can summarize it, who build their own infrastructure even though managed services exist — those people aren't wasting their time. They're building the only thing a machine can't replicate: *judgment*.

Knowing *how to think* about something is fundamentally different from having an answer handed to you. When I troubleshoot a network issue, I'm not just Googling error codes — I'm drawing on years of pattern recognition, failed experiments, and hard-won intuition about how systems behave. AI can suggest a fix. I can tell you if that fix will break something else three layers down. That muscle atrophies if you stop exercising it.

Every historical example in this post follows the same arc: we lost a specific skill but gained something broader. The question for our generation isn't whether AI will make certain skills obsolete. It will. The question is whether we'll mistake that for a reason to stop learning entirely — and hollow ourselves out in the process.

<div class="conclusion-box">
<div class="conclusion-header">tl;dr</div>
<div class="conclusion-body">Learning was never really about making yourself economically useful. It was about building the internal wiring that lets you understand the world. AI can give you answers. Only learning can give you the ability to know what questions are worth asking.</div>
